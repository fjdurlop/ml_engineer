# Part 2: ASR Evaluation Framework

## Overview
You need to benchmark ASR models across different dialects and measure WER vs latency trade-offs.

## Code: asr_evaluation_framework.py

## Tasks for Part 2

### 1. Comprehensive Evaluation Pipeline (60 mins)
Build an evaluation system that measures:

**Performance Metrics:**
- WER per dialect and overall
- Character Error Rate (CER)
- Real-time factor (RTF)
- 95th percentile latency

**Quality Analysis:**
- Error breakdown by phoneme/word type
- Performance correlation with audio duration
- Statistical significance testing across dialects
