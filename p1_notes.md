what is the task asking?
You need to benchmark ASR models across different dialects and measure WER vs latency trade-offs.


1. **"Walk me through your optimization decisions. What would you try next?"**
2. **"How would you handle a sudden 10x increase in traffic?"**
3. **"What monitoring metrics would you track in production?"**
4. **"How would you approach optimizing for mobile/edge deployment?"**
5. **"Describe a time when you had to balance model accuracy vs inference speed."**

done:

Missing:
- trade-offs analysis - check paper how
  - how:

Questions to prepare?
- how to do the dynamic selection?
- Specific optimizations for worst-performing cases
- Trade-off analysis: accuracy vs speed vs memory
