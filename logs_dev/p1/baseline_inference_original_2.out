Identified bottlenecks to optimize:
1. No batching - processing samples individually
2. Full precision (FP32) - no quantization
3. Synchronous operations - not overlapping computation
4. Inefficient memory usage - storing unnecessary intermediate results
5. No caching - recomputing static components
